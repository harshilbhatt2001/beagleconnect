== BeagleConnect™ Usage
This section describes the usage model we are developing. To use the current code in development,
please refer to the <<development>> section below.

[[enable-a-linux-host-with-beagleconnect]]
==== Enable a Linux host with BeagleConnect™

Step 1] Log into a host system running Linux that is BeagleConnect™
enabled. Enable a Linux host with BeagleConnect™ by plugging a
`BeagleConnect™ gateway device` into it's USB port. You'll also want to have a
`BeagleConnect™ node device` with a sensor, actuator or indicator device connected.

NOTE: _BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ can act as either a `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` or a
`BeagleConnect™ node device`.

IMPORTANT: The Linux host will need to run the `BeagleConnect™ management
software`, most of which is incorporated into the Linux kernel. Support will
be provided for BeagleBoard and BeagleBone boards, x86 hosts, and Raspberry Pi.

#TODO: Clean up images#

[[connect-host-and-device]]
=== Connect host and device

Step 2] Initiate a connection between the host and devices by pressing
the discovery button(s).

[[device-data-shows-up-as-files]]
=== Device data shows up as files

Step 3] New streams of self-describing data show up on the host system
using native device drivers.

High-level applications, like `Node-RED`, can directly read/write these high-level
data streams (including data-type information) to Internet-based https://mqtt.org/[MQTT] brokers,
live dashboards, or other logical operations without requiring any sensor-specific
coding. Business logic can be applied using simple if-this-then-that style operations
or be made as complex as desired using virtually any programming language or environment.

#TODO: Actually, Node-RED will make these show up automatically as streams.#

[[components]]
=== Components

BeagleConnect™ enabled host Linux computer, possibly single-board computer (SBC), with
`BeagleConnect™ management software` and `BeagleConnect™ gateway function`. `BeagleConnect™ gateway
function` can be provided by a `BeagleConnect™ compatible interface` or by connecting a
`BeagleConnect™ gateway device` over USB.


NOTE: If the Linux host has BLE, the BeagleConnect™ is optional for short distances


BeagleConnect™ Freedom Board, case, and wireless MCU with `Zephyr` based firmware for acting
as either a `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` or `BeagleConnect™ node device`.
* In `BeagleConnect™ gateway device` mode:
** Provides long-range, low-power wireless communications,
** Connects with the `host` via USB and an associated Linux kernel driver, and
** Is powered by the USB connector.
* In `BeagleConnect™ node device` mode:
** Powered by a battery or USB connector
** Provides 2 mikroBUS connectors for connecting any of hundreds of
https://bbb.io/click[Click Board] mikroBUS add-on devices
** Provides new Linux host controllers for SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, ADC, and
GPIO with interrupts via `Greybus`

BeagleConnect™ gateway device:: Provides a `BeagleConnect™ compatible interface` to a host. This
could be a built-in interface device or one connected over USB. _BeagleConnect™ Freedom_ can provide
this function.

BeagleConnect™ node device:: Utilizes a `BeagleConnect™ compatible interface` and #TODO#

BeagleConnect™ compatible interface:: Immediate plans are to support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4, and Sub-GHz IEEE 802.15.4 _wireless_ interfaces. A built-in BLE interface is
suitable for this at short range, whereas IEEE 802.15.4 is typically significantly better at long
ranges. Other _wired_ interfaces, such as _CAN_ and _RS-485_, are being considered for future
`BeagleConnect™ gateway device` and `BeagleConnect™ node device` designs.

Greybus:: #TODO#

#TODO: Find a place for the following notes:

** The device interfaces get exposed to the host via Greybus BRIDGED_PHY
protocol
** The I2C bus is probed for a an identifier EEPROM and appropriate
device drivers are loaded on the host
** Unsupported Click Boards connected are exposed via userspace drivers
on the host for development

[[whats-different]]
=== What's different

So, in summary, what is so different with this approach?

* No microcontroller code development is required by users
* Userspace drivers make rapid prototyping really easy
* Kernel drivers makes the support code collaborative parts of the Linux
kernel, rather than cut-and-paste
